    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Thomas Preston-Werner (born May 27, 1979) is an American billionaire
      software developer and entrepreneur. He is an active contributor within
      the free and open-source software community, most prominently in the San
      Francisco Bay Area, where he lives. He is best known as the founder and
      former CEO of GitHub, a Git repository web-based hosting service, which he
      co-founded in 2008 with Chris Wanstrath and P. J. Hyett.[3] He resigned
      from GitHub in 2014 when an internal investigation concluded that he and
      his wife harassed an employee.[4] Preston-Werner is also the creator of
      the avatar service Gravatar,[5] the TOML configuration file format,[6] the
      static site generator software Jekyll,[7][8] and the Semantic Versioning
      Specification (SemVer).[9]
